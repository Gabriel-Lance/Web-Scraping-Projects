"""
A web crawler that automatically plays the Getting to Philosophy game on Wikipedia.

By navigating to a Wikipedia article and clicking the first link in the body of the article that is not parenthesized,
and repeating this for each new page you visit, you are almost guaranteed to eventually reach the page on Philosophy.
This program asks the user for the title of a Wikipedia article and follows this path of links automatically.
